# MedicalSegmentation

*Project realised during a 6 months internship at IUCT Oncopole, France.*

This provides some deep Learning tools for automatic segmentation of medical images. The approach implemented for this project is to process the entire medical acquisition at the same time. One of the major challenges when processing this kind of data using deep learning algorithms is the memory usage, as depending on the modality and the study, an imaging serie can contains several hundreds or thousands of images.
